# Job Board

![Job Board Banner](./banner.png)

## Overview

**Job Board** is a full-stack web application that serves as a mini job board. It allows users to view public job listings, register and log in, and (if authenticated) access an admin dashboard to create and delete job postings. The project demonstrates my skills in developing modern web applications using Next.js, PostgreSQL, and Tailwind CSS, along with implementing secure authentication and dynamic client-side filtering.

---

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**
  - Secure signup and login functionality using email and password.
  - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for security.
  - Authentication is implemented via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- **Job Listings**
  - Public page displaying all job listings in a responsive grid.
  - Dynamic filtering of job listings by job type and location using searchable dropdowns.
  
- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Accessible only to authenticated users.
  - Supports creation and deletion of job postings.

- **Responsive UI**
  - Fully responsive design built with Tailwind CSS.
  - Custom navbar with conditional rendering based on authentication status.
  - Clean, modern, and consistent UI that adapts to mobile and desktop devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  - [Next.js 15.3](https://nextjs.org/) with the new App Router  
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) (client & server components)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

- **Backend:**  
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database
  - [pg](https://node-postgres.com/) for raw SQL queries

- **Authentication:**  
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication  
  - Passwords hashed using [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- PostgreSQL installed and running (or a remote instance)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-board.git
   cd job-board
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following (update with your actual credentials):

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://admin:1234@localhost:5432/job_board
   JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Set Up PostgreSQL:**

   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
   - Create your database (e.g., `job_board`).
   - Run the provided schema SQL (if not using migrations):

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE users (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       password TEXT NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );

     CREATE TABLE jobs (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       title TEXT NOT NULL,
       company TEXT NOT NULL,
       location TEXT NOT NULL,
       job_type TEXT NOT NULL,
       description TEXT NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );
     ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

### Public Job Listings

- Visit the home page (`/`) to see public job listings.
- Use the dropdown filters to search by job type or location.

### User Authentication

- **Register:** Visit `/register` to create a new account.
- **Login:** Visit `/login` to sign in.
- Upon successful login, a JWT token is stored in localStorage, and the Dashboard link becomes visible in the navbar.

### Admin Dashboard

- Visit `/dashboard` (accessible only when logged in) to:
  - Create new job postings.
  - Delete existing jobs.
  - Manage job listings.

## Design & Implementation Details

- **Next.js App Router & TypeScript:**  
  The project leverages the new App Router for improved routing and server rendering, ensuring optimum performance and better developer experience.

- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  Utilized for rapid UI development, offering responsiveness, a clean minimalistic design, and ease of customization.

- **Authentication:**  
  JWT-based authentication provides secure token generation and validation. Passwords are safely stored using bcrypt hashing.

- **Dynamic Filtering:**  
  Job listings can be filtered via dynamically generated, searchable dropdowns. This shows advanced state management and client-side interactivity using React Hooks.

- **RESTful API Endpoints:**  
  API routes are divided into public and protected (admin) endpoints ensuring security and a clear separation of concerns.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Error Handling & Notifications:**  
  Implement a global notification system for error/success messages.
- **Pagination or Infinite Scrolling:**  
  For improved scalability of the job listings page.
- **Advanced Role-Based Access Control:**  
  Allow for different user roles (e.g., recruiter, applicant) with tailored dashboards.
- **Enhanced UI/UX:**  
  Additional refinements based on user feedback and evolving design trends.

## Conclusion

This Job Board project showcases my ability to build a full-stack application from scratch using modern technologies. The project features secure authentication, dynamic user interactions, clean design with Tailwind CSS, and robust API implementations with PostgreSQL and raw SQL queries. I welcome any questions or feedback regarding the implementation details and design decisions.
